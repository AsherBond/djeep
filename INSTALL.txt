Instructions:

0) Do a minimal install of ubuntu 10.10
1) curl -Sks https://raw.github.com/willkelly/djeep/master/example_install.sh | bash
2) edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and put your hostname in the server= part. You'll have to create a line that is: 

server=infra.somedomain.com

That's supposed to go in the [main] section (the top one by default) 

3) pull down https://raw.github.com/willkelly/djeep/master/sample_data.json and stick it in /opt/djeep, then cd into /opt/djeep and run the following:

tools/with_venv.sh python manage.py loaddata sample_data.json

4) Change everything in djeep to your likings.

5) run the puppet client as root: puppetd -t

6) fix any pink output from the script

7) Kick the rest of your hosts!
